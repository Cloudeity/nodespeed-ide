Brackets Server
===============

Brackets Server is a server for providing hosted version of the popular code editor [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). The code editor can be loaded directly in the web browser and it doesnâ€™t require additional installations or browser extensions. Brackets works just like the desktop version, except that all projects and files reside on the server instead of the local file system.

The server may be useful for remote development, real-time changes and testing, development form thin clients or devices such as tablets, or it could be used in conjunction with other web applications for collaboration.

To check the current verion of Brackets source used in the server, please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

Installation
------------

Install from npm:

    $ npm install brackets -g

Usage Examples
--------------

    $ brackets --port 80 --proj-dir /var/projects --supp-dir /var/brackets

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure ***projects*** directory exists.

All arguments are optional.

| Short Option | Long Option  | Default Value     | Description
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
| `-p <prot>`  | `--port`     | `6800`            | TCP port on which Brackets server is listening.
| `-j <dir>`   | `--proj-dir` | `~/Projects`      | Root directory for projects. Directories above this root cannot be accessed.
| `-s <dir>`   | `--supp-dir` | `~/.brackets-srv` | Root directory for Brackets supporting files such as user extensions, configurations and state persistence.

Embedding Brackets Server in Web Applications
---------------------------------------------

Example with Express:

```javascript
    var path        = require("path"),
        http        = require("http"),
        express     = require("express"),
        brackets    = require("brackets"),
        app         = express(),
        server      = http.createServer(app);

    app.get("/", function (req, res) {
        res.send("Hello World");
    });

    var bracketsOpts = {
        projectsDir: path.join(__dirname, ".."),
        supportDir: path.join(__dirname, "..", "/support")
    };
    brackets(server, bracketsOpts);

    server.listen(3000);

    console.log("Your application is availble at http://localhost:3000");
    console.log("You can access Brackets on http://localhost:3000/brackets/");
```

**NOTE:** The default values for `projectsDir` and `supportDir` are different when Brackets Server is initiated from code. They are respectively `./projects` and `./brackets`, relative to the current working directory. Same as the CLI, the ***projects*** directory must exist, otherwise Open and Create project will not work.
