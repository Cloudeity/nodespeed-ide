nodeSpeed IDE
=============

nodeSpeed IDE is a server for providing hosted version of the popular code editor [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). 

It is initially based on the project [Brackets Server](https://github.com/rabchev/brackets-server). Thanks to [Boyan Rabchev](https://github.com/rabchev) for starting this project. 

The nodeSpeed IDE implementation uses a node express server and also includes passport modules to interact with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for user authentication. 

The Brackets code editor can be loaded directly in the web browser and it doesnâ€™t require additional installations or browser extensions. Brackets works just like the desktop version, except that all projects and files reside on the server instead of the local file system. 

nodeSpeed IDE is intended to be used with an implementation with Docker containers, making it fast and easy to spin up and run a hosted development environment. All of our testing is therefore done by running in a Docker environment. 

To check the current verion of Brackets source used in the server, please see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/whoGloo/nodespeed-ide/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation
Install the nodeSpeed IDE with one of the following options: 
- By cloning building and runinng
- By building a docker image and running the IDE from one or more containers using Docker
- By pulling and running a pre-built Docker image `whogloo/nodespeed-ide` and using this in `docker run` scripts.
- Sign up for an account on [Spinups.io](https://spinups.io), spin up an instance of nodeSpeed Development and get started in minutes.  

## Usage Examples
### Environment variables
To use the authentication and sign-in features of nodeSpeed Development, you will need a valid [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account and have a client created with valid callback URLs for returning to your IDE URL after successful authentication.

The following environment variables should be set on the machine (or Docker container) that the IDE is being launched from:  
#### Authentication : 
- **`NODESPEED_AUTHENTICATION_APPLICATION`**: Auth0 Client ID
- **`NODESPEED_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET`**: Auth0 Client Secret
- **`NODESPEED_AUTHENTICATION_DOMAIN`**: Auth0 Domain
- **`NODESPEED_AUTHENTICATION_CALLBACK_URL`**: Auth0 Callback URL

#### URLs for virtual hosts
**`VIRTUAL_HOST`** 
This is a variable often used by nginx-proxy containers to define URLS to access container services with. `nodespeedide.js` uses this variable to determine URLs for the IDE, the terminal, preview and web-scokets. 
For example: 

```
VIRTUAL_HOST=nodespeed-ide.whogloo.com:6800,tty-nodespeed-ide.whogloo.com:8080,preview-nodespeed-ide.whogloo.com:3000,wss-nodespeed-ide.whogloo.com:9485 
```

The `VIRTUAL_HOST` URL's must be defined in the above order. The nodeSpeed Terminal process currently depends the `tty-<base url>` being the second entry in the list. 

NB: An reverse proxy (e.g. nginx-proxy), Load Balancer or DNS entries pointing to the container URLs will need to be in place. 

To start from command line, use a command like the one below from the IDE installation directory: 

```
node nodespeedide --supp-dir /projects/.brackets-server -j /projects
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure the **/projects** directory exists.

All arguments are optional.

| Short Option | Long Option      | Default Value             | Description
|--------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
| `-p <prot>`  | `--port`         | `6800`                    | TCP port on which Brackets server is listening.
| `-j <dir>`   | `--proj-dir`     | `/projects `              | Root directory for projects. Directories above this root cannot be accessed.
| `-s <dir>`   | `--supp-dir`     | `/projects/.brackets-srv` | Root directory for Brackets supporting files such as user extensions, configurations and state persistence.
| `-d`         | `--user-domains` | `false`                   | Allows Node domains to be loaded from user extensions.

**NOTE:** Some Brackets extensions require external Node.js process, called node domain. Node domains run on the server, thereby allowing arbitrary code to be executed on the server through custom extensions.  Since this imposes very serious security and stability risks, Brackets Server will not load nor execute domains from user extensions, unless `-d` option is specified.

**NOTE:** The default values for `projectsDir` and `supportDir` are different when nodeSpeed IDE is initiated from code. They are respectively `./projects` and `./brackets`, relative to the current working directory.

Options:

| Option           | Default Value     | Description
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
| httpRoot         | `/brackets`       | Defines the root HTTP endpoint for Brackets Server (http://yourdomain.com/brackets).
| projectsDir      | `./projects`      | Root directory for projects. Directories above this root cannot be accessed.
| supportDir       | `./brackets`      | Root directory for Brackets supporting files such as user extensions, configurations and state persistence.
| allowUserDomains | `false`           | Allows Node domains to be loaded from user extensions.


## Suggested Brackets extensions
As part of the hosted version of nodeSpeed IDE (ndoeSpeed Development), a number of Brackets extensions have been developed or forked and updated to work in the nodeSpeed IDE. These extensions add extra functionality to the IDE in various ways. 

The following is a list of suggested nodeSpeed IDE specific extensions: 
- [**brackets-nodespeed-custom**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-nodespeed-custom): This is our main custom project and it adds extra menu items to the IDE, including extra navigation menu items for **Terminal** (nodeSpeed Terminal in a separate browser tab) and **Preview** (preview of applications run from the IDE using port 3000). 
- [**nodespeed-terminal**](https://github.com/whoGloo/nodespeed-terminal): Node Express project with Golden Layout used to implement a multi instance terminal that can run in a separate tab browser, attaching to the bash shell of the IDE machine (normally a Docker container)
- [**brackets-file-upload**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-file-upload): Extension to provide upload and download of files and directories from the IDE
- [**brackets-duplicate-extension**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-duplicate-extension): Extension to provide support for copying and duplicating files and folders

Custom forks of existing Brackets Extensions: 
- [**brackets-git**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-git): Custom fork of [brackets-git](https://github.com/zaggino/brackets-git). Kudos to [Martin Zagora](https://github.com/zaggino). 
- [**brackets-npm-extension**](https://github.com/whoGloo/brackets-npm-registry): Custom fork of [brackets-npm-registry](https://github.com/zaggino/brackets-npm-registry). Kudos to [Martin Zagora](https://github.com/zaggino). 

It has been necessary to modify some of the extensions for them to work with the IDE, as many of the existing extensions are dependent on local OS and filesystem features. 

There are several other extensioons that could be recommended for a productive implementation of nodeSpeed IDE. Suggestions are welcome.
